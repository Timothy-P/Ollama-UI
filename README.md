# Overview
A web browser-based menu or a Tkinter-based menu. The web browser version works better, as it works properly and has loads more features the Tkinter menu won't get.
# Tkinter menu
There's not much to say about it. It was a poor attempt at a menu gone awry. I might fix/work on it in the future, I might not.
# Web Browser menu
A whole lot better. You can have multiple chats, long chats, and it displays text properly. All you need to do is download the dependencies and run the file. Sound easy? It should.
