# Overview
It doesn't work as I wish it would. I have searched everything I can without going insane and this is all I can manage. If I could do it in a new UI then I would, but it seems like I'm gonna have to do it with another language. I might do PHP or Flutter instead, as those don't require making a UI out of a busted framework (no offense to the Tkinter devs).
# Issues
The only issue you'll have is it only being a one-and-done chat with the model of choice. And, of course, you will need to have Ollama installed. Other than that, the right frame doesn't resize properly and the text freaks out and doesn't seem to ever be on screen properly.
# Result
A half-working menu. It sends prompts and retrieves the response once the Ollama has done its job. The whole thing is probably gonna be remade in a web page instead, as I can't find a good UI framework to use (not that there aren't alternatives).
# Web Menu Update
I don't have the files currently uploaded but I'm thinking about including an instillation of Ollama due to technical issues. Depends on how it goes, I suppose.
