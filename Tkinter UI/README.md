# Issues

Please be aware this was a broken prototype. It was never finished, nor did I have the ability to fix/complete it.

If you choose to work on it, let me know and I'll publish your changes. Otherwise, it'll remain in this state, as I could never get it to work.

# Menu

It doesn't look very pretty. If you look at [Current-design.png](Current-design.png), you'll see what I mean.

The panels don't scale correctly and the text doesn't wrap at all (if I'm remembering correctly).

# Want to help?

If you want to help, my contact info is on my profile. I always welcome advice or assistance, as I know I'm never going to do this perfectly, as you see here.

# Enjoy

Even if it doesn't work the greatest, I do hope you enjoy what little has been done. Just be aware the AI will respond without context, as it goes to a new "chat" every time. Why? I'm not sure.
